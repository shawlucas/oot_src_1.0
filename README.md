# Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time NTSC 1.0 Disassembly

Put a decompressed Ocarina of Time 1.0 NTSC-J ROM in the folder, named "baserom.z64" Make sure it has the correct md5sum.

Run make -C tools

Run python3 extract_baserom.py

Then run make

It builds the following ROM:
* zelda_ocarina_NTSC `md5: a6090ade6efb0490f5e74838d47bbfac`

Credits given to everyone on the Ocarina of Time decompilation team. Most of these function names and documentation are from them.

Special thanks to glank, mzxrules, Fig, Roman, and everyone involved in Ocarina of Time decompilation for pretty much all the information.

disclaimer: some things might not be right or even compilable. i have been working on debug decomp recently so i haven't gotten around to this as much.
